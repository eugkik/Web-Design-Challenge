# Web-Design-Challenge

The index.html file is the landing web page with summary and visualization sections.  The visualization images are links to the individual pages.

A navigation bar on each page has links back to the landing page, as well as links to each plot page, a comparison page, and a data page.

Each visualization page has a large scatter plot along with thumbnails to the other visualization pages.  The active page's thumbnail is highlighted on each page.

The comparison page shows all four scatter plots. Each image is a link to the individual visualization page.

The data page displays a table of all the data used for plotting, which was exported from a CSV file.
